# Catlady
Game for ludum dare 40 (compo).
In Catlady you naturally play as the Catlady. Be sure to keep up with your neighbor’s affairs and don’t let the great amount of cats and whatever else you will accumulate get the better of you!

Tips: The mission will hint at a direction. Go take a look through that window! 
As for the cats, they are of course moving your stuff around and dragging in more stuff over time. And when they do, they will let you know…
